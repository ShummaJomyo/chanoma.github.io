However, for beginner students of programming, many factors are difficult to learn. One reason is that they cannot visually check the middle of the programming process. In this paper, we propose an introductory programming education using Simulink and Stateflow for new students in the National College of Technology (KOSEN). Results of questionnaire survey and semester final examination demonstrated that the proposed method has a positive effect on introductory programming education.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"“SimulinkとStateflowを用いたプログラミング導入教育の効果”","type":"publication"},{"authors":["城明 舜磨","平野 旭","山脇 正雄","中村 浩士"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1542412800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"ja","lastmod":1542412800,"objectID":"ff88332dab9906cd16f2ec7ca110a7b7","permalink":"/publication/conf-chusei2020/","publishdate":"2018-11-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conf-chusei2020/","section":"publication","summary":"スマートフォンには，振動状態を数値化する加速度センサなどが搭載されており，体に押し付けることによって，体動情報から心拍数や呼吸回数が推定可能である．さらには，これら2つのパラメータを用いて定量的に算出した「ストレス指数」の提示も可能になる．本研究では，中性脂肪を減らす運動対策に向けて，運動後の「ストレス指数」の改善を提示することで行動変容につなげるアプリの開発研究について報告する．","tags":null,"title":"“スマートフォンアプリ開発による行動変容支援”","type":"publication"},{"authors":["城明 舜磨","平野 旭","曽 智","吉田 将之","辻 敏夫"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"ja","lastmod":1530403200,"objectID":"9d1e9e292ad5d3e5b5748cbec35e065e","permalink":"/publication/conf-ieej2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conf-ieej2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Bioassay monitoring is a method for detecting environmental change using animals. It has an advantage over the traditional chemical analysis methods in continuous monitoring of potential toxicity risks on the animals. In this study, we focus on the biological electric signal called ventilatory wave of the killifish because it sensitively responds to environmental changes. This paper presents a toxicity detection algorithm for water using ventilatory waves. Because the features of ventilatory waves are affected by both water quality and physiological state of the fish, we trained the one-class support vector machine using the ventilator wave features of the last few hours to detect the outlier. The experimental results confirmed that the ventilator waves of killifishes do not show short term change if water quality is stable, and the proposed method can detect artificial administration of toxic substance within a few hours.","tags":null,"title":"メダカの呼吸波を利用した水の毒性検出アルゴリズムの提案","type":"publication"},{"authors":["城明 舜磨","平野 旭","曽 智","辻 敏夫"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506816000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"ja","lastmod":1506816000,"objectID":"e087a8d711c173e3d8e41f4a469de782","permalink":"/publication/conf-rentai2017/","publishdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conf-rentai2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"メダカの呼吸波計測にむけた電極配置の提案","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"ja","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
